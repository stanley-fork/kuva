## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **PDF backend migrated from `svg2pdf` to `krilla`/`krilla-svg`, plus multi-page output** — `svg2pdf` was archived upstream by its own maintainer as unmaintained, recommending `krilla`/`krilla-svg` (same author, used by Typst) as the successor. `PdfBackend::render_scenes(&[Scene])` and the one-shot `render_to_pdf_multi(pages)` render one kuva canvas per PDF page into a single document (like R's `pdf()` device, e.g. for fgbio/Picard-style reports); nothing is rasterized. By default each page takes its scene's natural size; `PdfBackend::with_page_size(PageSize::inches(11.0, 8.5))` instead coerces every page to a fixed size, scaling each scene proportionally to fit and centering it, with the scene's own background color filling the letterbox margin. **The `pdf` feature now requires Rust >= 1.92** (krilla's MSRV) — higher than kuva's own crate-level `rust-version` (kept at 1.87 deliberately; see README.md's note on why), tracked separately as `[package.metadata.msrv] pdf_feature` in `Cargo.toml`. CI's `msrv` job now builds `cli,png,embed_font` (not `cli,full`) against `rust-version`, plus a new `pdf-msrv` job that builds `cli,full` against `pdf_feature` specifically — the pre-existing `msrv` job would otherwise have silently asserted a false claim (that `full` builds at 1.87) forever, since nothing else exercises that combination at the older toolchain. `PdfBackend` is no longer a zero-sized unit struct usable as a bare value (`PdfBackend.render_scene(...)`) — use `PdfBackend::new()`.
- **`kuva twin-y` CLI subcommand** — dual-axis plot from the command line: two series sharing an x-axis but with independent primary (left) and secondary (right) y-scales, e.g. temperature vs. rainfall. Supports `line` and `scatter` as the plot type on either axis (`--primary-type`/`--secondary-type`); per-side color and legend label flags; new shared `--y2-label`/`--y2-min`/`--y2-max`/`--log-y2`/`--y2-tick-format` flags. Closes #106.
- **`Layout::with_y2_axis_min`/`with_y2_axis_max`** — unconditional secondary-Y-axis bound overrides, mirroring `with_y_axis_min`/`with_y_axis_max`. Found needed while building the `twin-y` CLI: the existing `with_y2_range` still gets nice-rounded and capped near the secondary plots' own data (the same path the auto-computed range takes), so a requested bound far from the data was largely ignored.
- **CLI date/time X axis (`--x-date-format`, `--x-date-unit`, `--x-date-tick-format`, `--x-date-tick-step`)** on `scatter` and `line` — parses the X column as a date/time using a `strftime`-style format instead of a plain number, then ticks it with a `DateTimeAxis` (auto-selected unit/format by default, or an explicit unit with a sensible default tick format, overridable). Closes #107.
- **`Layout::with_label_background`** — a semi-opaque background rect behind in-fill value labels (Treemap, Sunburst, Mosaic, Funnel, Gantt), for readability over busy fills or BW-mode hatch patterns. Off by default in color mode; on automatically in BW mode; overridable either way. CLI: `--label-background`. Closes #102.
- **`Layout::with_subtitle`** — render a secondary line centred under the title for a one-line data summary (e.g. `n = 1,234 cells`). Sized at `round(0.7 × title_size)` by default or set explicitly with `with_subtitle_size`; coloured by muting the title colour toward the background so it adapts to light and dark themes rather than a fixed grey; word-wrapped independently of the title via `with_subtitle_wrap`. The title block reserves the extra height automatically so the plot is pushed down rather than overlapped. CLI: `--subtitle` and `--subtitle-wrap` on every subcommand. See *Reference → Layout*.
- **`ParetoPlot`** — bar chart of category values, sorted descending by default, with a superimposed cumulative-percentage line on a secondary axis (fixed 0-100%, the "80/20 rule" chart). Optional dashed threshold reference line (default 80%, labeled with its percentage) and per-point cumulative-percentage labels. Legend shown by default ("Value" / "Cumulative %"). Secondary-axis ticks are formatted as percentages (`0%`, `20%`, …). Categorical axis defaults to rotated (-45°), collision-thinned labels. `.with_max_categories(n)` collapses a long tail of small categories into one stacked "Other" bar, decoded via per-segment legend entries, instead of cluttering the axis. `.with_horizontal(bool)` puts categories on Y and values on X. CLI: `kuva pareto`.
- **Secondary X-axis (`Layout::with_x2_range`/`with_x2_label`/`with_log_x2`/`with_x2_tick_format`, `ComputedLayout::map_x2`)** — a top-drawn counterpart to the existing secondary Y-axis (right side), for plots whose secondary encoding pairs with the value axis rather than the category axis (used by horizontal `ParetoPlot`). Third-party plot types can use it directly via the same `Layout`/`ComputedLayout` fields.

### Fixed

- **`examples/all_plots_simple.rs`/`all_plots_complex.rs` (the "every plot type in one figure" gallery assets) were missing `ParetoPlot`, `BandPlot`, and `LegendPlot`** — Replaced some plot repeats to include missing plot types.
- **`man/kuva.1` was missing the `twin-y` subcommand** — regenerated (`kuva man > man/kuva.1`).
- **`Scatter3D`/`Surface3D` instances combined in one panel now share one 3D coordinate box** — each instance previously called `data_ranges()`/drew its own wireframe box independently, so two `Scatter3D` (or a mix with `Surface3D`) in the same `render_multiple` call each normalized to their own min/max and could project completely different data onto identical screen coordinates, with the box itself drawn twice. `render_multiple` now computes one merged `DataRanges3D` and draws the box once, shared by every 3D instance in the call.
- **Twin-Y x-axis no longer clips a secondary series that extends further than the primary series** — `Layout::auto_from_twin_y_plots`'s `with_y2_auto` unioned the *padded* x-range across primary and secondary, but left `data_x_range` (the *raw* extent used by the axis-range capping added for [#98](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/98)) pinned to primary's range alone. When the capped branch triggered, the x-axis max was computed from primary's raw max instead of the true combined max, rounding the axis short and clipping secondary's data past that point. `data_x_range` is now unioned across both series.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Black & white / accessibility mode** (resolves [#14](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/14)) — `Layout::with_bw_mode()` / CLI `--bw` redraws any plot so it stays legible without relying on color: discrete series (bar, box, violin, pie, area, …) cycle through 5 grey shades × 7 hatch patterns (35 combinations before any repeat), line plots cycle through 4 dash styles, scatter/point plots cycle through 6 marker shapes, and continuous colormaps (heatmap, hexbin, contour, calendar, …) are forced to a grayscale ramp. Works on every plot type, including pixel-space/composite plots (Chord, Sankey, PhyloTree, Synteny, Network, Treemap, Sunburst, Clustermap) which each needed a bespoke fill/stroke treatment. See *Reference → Black & White / Accessibility Mode*.

### Changed

- **Text width is now measured from real DejaVu Sans glyph advances** instead of a per-call-site `char_count × font_size × factor` heuristic. A single `text_metrics` module measures every axis tick label, legend entry, title, and in-plot label against the bundled font's actual advance widths (shipped as a precompiled table, so the SVG-only default build gains real metrics with no new runtime dependency). Layout reservations now match what is rendered — exact for PNG/PDF and `embed_font` SVG, a close fails-safe estimate for bare SVG — which removes a class of label-clipping and label-overlap issues and tightens over-wide legend boxes. Non-ASCII/multi-byte labels are measured by glyph rather than UTF-8 byte length, so they are no longer over-reserved 2–3×.
- **Default font cascade now lists Verdana before the Arial-family fallbacks** — `DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY` is now `"DejaVu Sans, Verdana, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans-serif"`. Layout reserves space using DejaVu Sans metrics, but when DejaVu is unavailable (the common case for bare SVG on Windows/macOS, where it is not installed) the consumer substitutes the next family in the cascade. Verdana shares DejaVu's Bitstream Vera lineage and is a near-exact metric match (~1.5% mean width difference vs. ~12% for Arial/Liberation/Helvetica), and ships on essentially all Windows and macOS systems — so labels render at close to the reserved size. Linux still resolves to DejaVu (exact) or Liberation as before.
- **Vertical text is now positioned from real DejaVu Sans metrics** instead of `font_size × factor` guesses. The `text_metrics` module gained ascent/descent/cap-height/x-height/line-height accessors (measured from the bundled face and shipped in the precompiled table alongside the advance widths), and the vertical text quantities — line heights, title/axis/tick-label baselines, reserved band and box heights, and cap-height centring — are now driven by them, across both the core layout and the individual plot types (axis ticks, dice, venn, bump, streamgraph, calendar, multi-panel figure labels, …). Cap-height-based centring (`cap_height / 2`) replaces the ubiquitous `font_size × 0.35` guess, so text sits on its true optical centre and tracks the font instead of assuming a fixed ratio. Deliberately-loose leading (e.g. TextPlot, radar, legend list spacing) is left as a typographic choice, not a metric.

### Fixed

- **Colorbar tick labels no longer clip at the canvas edge** — the colorbar's right-margin reservation was a fixed `90 px`, so a wide tick label (e.g. a 6-digit `100000` on a large-count hexbin) overran the 30 px label allotment and clipped against the canvas edge. The reservation and the colorbar's horizontal inset are now sized to the widest tick label, measured *after* applying `with_colorbar_tick_format` (`Layout::auto_from_plots` collects the colorbar's tick values so the width can be computed once the final format is known). When the canvas width is fixed too narrow for the full reservation, the tick-label font is shrunk to fit the available band rather than clipping. Hand-built layouts (no `auto_from_plots`) keep the previous fixed reservation.
- **Log/count colorbars now honour `Layout::with_colorbar_tick_format`** — the log-scale colorbar used by `HexbinPlot` and `Histogram2D` (with log colouring) generated its own hard-coded power-of-ten integer labels and ignored the configured colorbar tick format, so a custom formatter (e.g. an SI formatter producing `1k`, `10k`, `100k`) had no effect. `ColorBarInfo` gains a `tick_values` field carrying `(position, value)` pairs; the value is formatted through `with_colorbar_tick_format` at render time, matching how the linear colorbar already behaved. Default (`TickFormat::Auto`) output is unchanged for integer count labels.
- **Colorbar tick overprint on log/count colorbars** — the log-scale colorbar (hexbin and 2-D histogram with log colouring) appends a tick at the exact data maximum in addition to the nearest power-of-ten tick. In log space the two can sit a fraction of a decade apart, so their labels overprinted at the top of the bar. Adjacent colorbar tick labels closer than one label height are now thinned — entries are drawn bottom-to-top and the first of any too-close pair is kept, so the round decade tick survives and the redundant data-max label is dropped only when it would actually collide.
- **`Figure`-embedded colorbars lost the width-aware label reservation** — `clone_layout` didn't copy the new `colorbar_tick_values` field, so any colorbar inside a multi-panel `Figure` silently fell back to the legacy fixed reservation instead of sizing to its widest label.
- **`Treemap`/`Sunburst` colorbars were excluded from the width-aware label reservation** — both set up a colorbar but had no arm in the estimator that collects tick values for sizing, so large values (7+ digit labels) relied entirely on the render-time font-shrink fallback instead of a properly sized reservation.
- **`PopulationPyramid` single-series legend width ignored the actual label text** — the `left_label`/`right_label` legend never measured real text width, leaving the legend box pinned at a bare 40px offset regardless of label length, so long labels could overflow the box.
- **`HorizonPlot` `+`/`-` sign-to-value spacing used an average character width** instead of the actual glyph width, producing a visibly inconsistent gap after `+` vs `-`.
- **`Figure`'s shared multi-panel legend kept a stale 80px minimum width** after the rest of the legend-sizing code moved to content-hugging real-metric widths, so short shared legends were padded wider than necessary.
- **Titles and labels no longer clip or overlap when enlarged** — figure and jointplot title bands now scale with `title_size` (they were fixed 30/35 px and clipped larger titles); wrapped title and axis-label lines stack by real line height; and rotated x-tick labels and staggered second rows reserve their true vertical extent, fixing clipping at steep angles and crowding of the x-axis title.
- **Heatmap and brick in-cell value labels are centred on their true cap-height midpoint** (they previously rode high). Heatmap labels also shrink uniformly to fit the cell and drop rather than overflow into neighbours when cells are too short to render legibly — and a single wide outlier value no longer shrinks the whole grid below the floor and blanks every label (the too-wide value is dropped instead).
- **Legend boxes hug their contents** — comfortable `body_size`-scaled row leading with the box sized to the rows actually drawn, so legends no longer carry uneven top/bottom padding or a fixed row height that overflowed at larger body sizes; applied consistently across the main, standalone, and figure legend paths.
- **The x-axis title renders on tick-suppressed plots** — Manhattan plots (which draw their own chromosome labels) keep the "Chromosome" title, and the bottom margin reserves room for it so it clears those labels instead of overprinting them.
- **`scatter3d --color-by` legend box was over-wide** — the CLI sized the box with a char-count proxy plus a hard 80px floor, leaving dead space beside short group labels. Now routes through the shared `Layout::with_legend_entries`, which measures the widest label (box 80 → 49px for typical short labels).
- **Colorbar tick-label band was mildly under-reserved for long labels** — the last width estimate left over from before the text-metrics work used `max_chars × tick_size × 0.6`; DejaVu's digit advance is closer to `0.636em`, so 6-digit labels were reserved a couple of px narrower than needed. Now measures each formatted label directly.
- **Minor gridlines now cover the whole plot area** — minor ticks were only generated *between* consecutive major ticks, so when an axis range didn't start or end on a major tick (explicit `with_x_axis_min`/`with_x_axis_max`, clamped, histogram bin-edge, or log ranges) the leading and trailing bands beyond the outer majors had no minor gridlines (or minor tick marks). Minors are now generated as if one more major tick existed just past each end — a geometric step on log axes (the next power of ten, preserving the familiar wide-to-squished 2..9 per-decade spacing) and an arithmetic step otherwise — then filtered to the axis range, so the partial intervals fill correctly without anything drawn outside the plot.
- **Categorical axes no longer leave dead space past the last category** — the render-time axis-range step ran `auto_nice_range` on every axis without a log/clamp/histogram guard, so a categorical axis (bar, box, violin, waterfall, candlestick, pyramid, strip, dot plot, …) had its exact `[0.5, n+0.5]` slot extent rounded outward to a "nice" number — e.g. `[0.5, 20.5]` → `[0, 25]` for a 20-bar chart, leaving ~108 px of empty plot area to the right of the last bar (and the analogous gap on the categorical axis of other layouts). Categorical axes now use their exact category extent (mirroring the existing histogram guard); their tick marks come from the category list rather than the numeric range, so the bars/boxes fill the plot width.
- **Continuous axes no longer over-provision when the data's max already lands on a "nice" tick** (resolves [#98](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/98)) — a small breathing-room pad is added to the raw data range before nice-rounding so a data point at the exact boundary doesn't render flush against the plot edge, but when the raw max was itself already a multiple of the chosen tick step, even that tiny pad was enough to round a whole extra major tick onto the axis — e.g. data spanning `[0, 20]` on a step-5 grid rounded out to `(0, 25)`, a phantom tick with a quarter of the plot as dead space. The margin added in that specific case is now capped at `min(half a tick step, 5% of the data's span)` instead of a full tick, and the resulting boundary may not itself land on a tick (ticks are generated separately and simply stop at the boundary). Axes where the data does *not* land exactly on a tick are unaffected — ordinary nice-rounding already provides natural headroom there.
- **Legend line swatches truncated multi-segment dash patterns** — the swatch line for a `LegendShape::Line` entry was a fixed 12px regardless of dash pattern, so `LineStyle::DashDot`'s `"8 4 2 4"` cycle (18px per repeat) was cut off right after its dash and gap — the dot segment never rendered, making the legend swatch look like a plain dash. The swatch now sizes to fit at least one full pattern repeat (capped so it can't run into the label text); solid and short patterns (`Dashed`, `Dotted`) are unaffected since they already fit within 12px.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Math in labels** — any label (title, axis labels, `TextPlot` markdown bodies) may embed `$...$` math written in LaTeX-ish syntax (`$\sigma^2$`, `$\frac{a}{b}$`, `$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$`). Math regions are lowered to inline Unicode — Greek letters, operators, super/subscripts (all-or-nothing, with a clean `x^(2q)` fallback), `\frac`→`a/b`, `\sqrt`→`√(…)` — by every backend including the terminal. Zero dependencies, always on; a literal dollar is written `\$`. See *Reference → Math in Labels*.
- **`QuiverPlot`** — 2-D vector field rendered as arrows. Each arrow has a tail at `(x, y)` and a vector `(u, v)`. Features: `from_function()` constructor for sampling a closure on a regular grid; auto-scaled arrow length (longest arrow ≈ one grid cell via a `span/√n` heuristic) or explicit `with_scale`; proportional arrow heads that make every arrow "look like an arrow" regardless of magnitude; three pivot modes (`Tail`, `Middle`, `Tip`); optional magnitude-driven colormap with automatic colorbar; `tight_bounds` opt-in for dense fields and independent `with_clip_to_plot_area()` for plot-area clipping; combo helper `with_magnitude_colormap(cmap, label)`. CLI: `kuva quiver`.
- **Pre-compiled release binaries** — pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag now builds standalone `kuva` CLI binaries (with the `cli,full` feature set: SVG + PNG + PDF) for Linux (x86_64 gnu/musl, aarch64), macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Windows (x86_64), and attaches them with SHA-256 checksums to the matching GitHub Release. Users can download a binary and run it without installing Rust. See `.github/workflows/release.yml` (resolves #17).
- **`AxisLabelOverlap` — collision-aware x-axis label thinning** — `Layout::with_x_label_overlap(AxisLabelOverlap)` opts any plot into collision-aware x-axis labelling. Three modes: `Allow` (default — existing behaviour), `Thin` (left-to-right pass; skip any label whose estimated footprint overlaps the previous one), and `Stagger` (alternate two vertical offsets so adjacent labels no longer need horizontal clearance). Works with both upright and rotated (`Layout::with_x_tick_rotate`) labels. `ManhattanPlot` gains the convenience builder `with_thin_overlapping_labels()`. CLI: `--x-label-overlap allow|thin|stagger` on all subcommands.
- **`.parquet` input for all CLI subcommands** — all ~50 CLI subcommands can read `.parquet` files directly (extension sniffing), or detect parquet piped via stdin by magic bytes (`PAR1` header/footer). Uses projected Arrow reads via `ParquetRecordBatchReaderBuilder` + `ProjectionMask::roots()` — only requested columns are decoded; 35–154× faster and 7–29× less memory than full-file row API on wide files. Gated behind `--features parquet`. (Community PR #79 by mud2monarch; extended to all subcommands in this release.)
- **Horizontal mode for `BarPlot`, `BoxPlot`, `ViolinPlot`, `RaincloudPlot`** — `.with_horizontal(true)` rotates any of these charts so categories appear on the Y-axis and values on the X-axis. Useful when category labels are long or when a horizontal layout reads more naturally. Slot-fraction width/gap builders work identically in both orientations. CLI: `--horizontal` flag added to `kuva bar`, `kuva box`, `kuva violin`, `kuva raincloud`.
- **CLI multi-column `--y` extended** — `--y A,B,C` (comma-separated column names or indices) is now supported on `histogram`, `bar`, `strip`, `violin`, `box`, `density`, and `ridgeline` in addition to the `scatter` and `line` subcommands added in v0.2.0. One series / group / ridge / curve is created per column; legend labels use column header names. Bar mode aggregates rows by `--label-col` (mean by default; `--agg` overrides). All existing `--group-col` / `--value-col` flags remain supported.
- **Enclosed plots — `AxisLine::Internal` and `AxisLine::Mirrored`** — `Layout::with_axis_line(AxisLine)` controls how axes are drawn. `AxisLine::Open` (renamed from the previous `Left`) draws a standard open axis; `AxisLine::Internal` draws tick marks inward; `AxisLine::Mirrored` draws ticks on both sides of the plot area. (PR #77.)
- **`embed_font` Cargo feature** — `flate2` is now optional. The new `embed_font` feature gates font embedding in SVG output; the `png` and `pdf` features pull in `flate2` for their own font loading; SVG-only builds no longer depend on it. The `fonts` module is gated on `any(embed_font, png, pdf)`. (Adapted from PR #81 by Zodey-hub.)
- **`NetworkPlot` enhancements** — cubic-Bézier curved edges via `.with_curves(true)`; inside-node label placement (labels drawn centred inside node circles for compact graphs); legend group color fix (group entries now use the correct per-group color rather than a single fallback).
- **Bundled font variants (Bold, Oblique, Mono)** — DejaVu Sans Bold, Oblique, and Mono TTFs are now bundled (gzip-compressed, inflated on first use via `OnceLock`). All three are gated behind `#[cfg(any(feature = "png", feature = "pdf", feature = "embed_font"))]` — SVG-only builds pay no binary-size cost. The `embed_font` `@font-face` block now embeds all four variants with correct `font-weight`/`font-style` descriptors so bold, italic, and code spans in `TextPlot` render correctly in self-contained SVGs.
- **`TextPlot` `code` span markup** — backtick syntax (`` `code` ``) is now parsed by `parse_inline_markup` and produces a `TextSpan { code: true }`. SVG renders code spans with `font-family="DejaVu Sans Mono,monospace"`; PNG/PDF use the bundled DejaVu Sans Mono font face.
- **`TextPlot` full markup in PNG/PDF** — bold, italic, and code spans now render correctly in PNG and PDF. Each span is drawn with the matching bundled font face (Bold / Oblique / Mono); text metrics are computed per-font so multi-style lines are correctly anchored.

### Fixed

- **Tick generation overflow (#80)** — `generate_ticks` used an absolute loop guard `end + 1e-8`; on sub-1e-8 data ranges (e.g. values in the 1e-10 range) the guard was never reached and the loop could produce millions of ticks or run indefinitely. Fixed with a relative tolerance `step.abs() * 1e-6` plus scale-invariant significant-figure rounding.
- **Y-axis label centering without title (#83)** — the y-axis label y-position was computed from the canvas centre (`height / 2`); when no title was present this placed the label above the plot midpoint. Corrected to `margin_top + plot_height() / 2`.
- **Legend box right-padding** — the auto-sizing formula `max_chars * 7.2 + 35` underestimated required box width, clipping long labels at larger font sizes or scale factors. Updated to `max_chars * 8.5 + 41`.
- **Negative values in CLI numeric flags** — `--y-min`, `--y-max`, `--x-min`, `--x-max`, `--x-tick-step`, `--y-tick-step` now accept negative numbers (e.g. `--x-min -1.5`) without being misinterpreted as unknown flags. Fixed via `allow_hyphen_values = true` on the relevant arguments.
- **BrickPlot multifigure bleed** — row heights are now normalized to a consistent pixel height when `BrickPlot` is placed inside a `Figure` panel, preventing render bleed into adjacent cells.
- **`group_by` performance** — changed from O(n²) to O(n) using a `HashMap` + insertion-order `Vec`. Affects all CLI subcommands that use `--color-by` or grouped input.

### Changed

- **PNG backend — new raster pipeline** — `PngBackend` now uses a direct RGBA pixel-buffer rasterizer with `fontdue` text rendering. The previous `resvg`-based SVG round-trip path is removed. Renders are faster and no longer depend on `resvg` or `usvg`. `PngBackend` retains its existing public API as a compatibility shim over the new `RasterBackend`.
- **`BrickPlot` legend improvements** — new builders `with_legend_columns(n)` (fixed column count) and `with_legend_max_entries(n)` (cap before overflow); legend entries per column are now evenly distributed. Prevents legend overflow when many repeat motifs are present.
- **Refactor: `render_utils::arrow_head_path`** — factored a shared arrow-head triangle helper now used by `QuiverPlot`, `NetworkPlot` (directed-edge arrowheads), and `TextAnnotation` arrows. Eliminates three inlined copies of the same geometry.
- **Refactor: `colorbar_linear` helper** in `render/plots.rs` — consolidates six near-identical `Arc<Fn>` closures that built linearly-normalized colorbars across `Heatmap`, `DotPlot`, `DicePlot`, `Contour`, `Clustermap`, and (new) `Quiver`. The 3-D `colorbar_from_z` path also routes through it now.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- **`DensityPlot::with_fit()`** — opts the density plot out of zero-anchoring so the y-axis fits the data range instead of starting at 0. Useful for precomputed curves (`DensityPlot::from_curve`) whose y values never reach zero. Standard KDE curves always taper to zero at the tails, so this flag has its primary effect on precomputed data. `fit_y` is also respected by `bounds()` for precomputed curves: the reported y_min now tracks the actual curve minimum rather than hardcoding 0. CLI: `kuva density --fit`.
- **`kuva::silverman_bandwidth` / `kuva::simple_kde` / `kuva::simple_kde_reflect`** — KDE computation functions are now part of the public API. Use these to pre-compute density curves before passing them to `DensityPlot::from_curve`, enabling inspection of the y range prior to setting axis bounds.
- **`Figure::with_row_height(row, px)`** — overrides the height of a single grid row (0-based). Rows without an explicit override use the default `cell_height`. Useful for thin legend strips, compact annotation rows, or asymmetric layouts where one row should be much taller or shorter than the others.
- **`Figure::with_col_width(col, px)`** — overrides the width of a single grid column (0-based). Columns without an explicit override use the default `cell_width`.
- **`with_figure_size` + explicit rows/cols** — when `with_figure_size` is combined with per-row or per-col overrides, the explicit sizes are subtracted first and the remaining space is divided equally among unconstrained rows/cols, so the total SVG size is still exactly honoured.
- **`LegendPlot` auto-column reflow** — when a `LegendPlot` is placed in a short cell (e.g. a thin legend row), the renderer now automatically increases the column count until all entries fit within the available cell height. Previously, entries overflowed the bottom of the cell.

### Added

- **`Figure::with_row_height(row, px)`** — overrides the height of a single grid row (0-based). Rows without an explicit override use the default `cell_height`. Useful for thin legend strips, compact annotation rows, or asymmetric layouts where one row should be much taller or shorter than the others.
- **`Figure::with_col_width(col, px)`** — overrides the width of a single grid column (0-based). Columns without an explicit override use the default `cell_width`.
- **`with_figure_size` + explicit rows/cols** — when `with_figure_size` is combined with per-row or per-col overrides, the explicit sizes are subtracted first and the remaining space is divided equally among unconstrained rows/cols, so the total SVG size is still exactly honoured.
- **`LegendPlot` auto-column reflow** — when a `LegendPlot` is placed in a short cell (e.g. a thin legend row), the renderer now automatically increases the column count until all entries fit within the available cell height. Previously, entries overflowed the bottom of the cell.
- **`LegendPlot`** — new plot type that renders a pure legend grid with no axes or data. Designed to occupy a dedicated figure cell so multiple data panels can share one legend without duplicating it; also usable standalone. Entries are supplied directly via `LegendPlot::from_entries(entries)` or built incrementally with `with_entry`. Column count is auto-computed from the available cell width using a conservative all-caps character-width estimate (`0.68 × font_size`), or fixed with `with_cols(n)`. Supports an optional title (`with_title`) and background box suppression (`without_box`). `LegendPlot` and `collect_legend_entries` are now re-exported from `kuva::prelude`.

- **`LegendPosition::OutsideBottomColumns`** — places all legend entries below the plot in an auto-packed multi-column grid. Column width is estimated from the longest label at `0.68` character-width; the canvas height is automatically extended to fit every entry (no truncation). Use via `Layout::with_legend_position(LegendPosition::OutsideBottomColumns)`.

- **`TextPlot`** — new plot type for placing formatted, word-wrapped text inside a figure cell alongside data plots. Supports an optional title, body text with inline markdown-style markup (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `__underline__`), heading lines (`# H1`, `## H2`), horizontal rules (`---`), paragraph spacing (blank lines), optional background fill, configurable border, text alignment (left/center/right), font size, padding, and text color. Rendered via `Primitive::RichText` — a new multi-span primitive that emits `<tspan>` children in SVG (and the raster backend's mini-SVG overlay), giving pixel-accurate inline styling. PNG and PDF inherit the SVG output automatically; the terminal backend flattens spans to plain text. Word wrapping always breaks on full words, never mid-word. Resolves [#72](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/72).
- **Date/time axis documentation** — new reference page `docs/src/reference/datetime.md` with four worked examples (monthly line, scatter with dates, multi-series, hourly), covering `ymd()`, `ymd_hms()`, `DateTimeAxis` constructors, `.with_step()`, auto mode, and conversion notes for `chrono`, `time`, and `std::time`. `examples/datetime.rs` generates the accompanying SVG assets. Closes [#32](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/32).
- **`GanttPlot`** — Gantt chart with horizontal task bars, optional group/phase grouping, group header background bands, per-task progress fill, milestone diamonds, "now" reference line, and smart label placement (inside bar when wide enough, to the right otherwise). Tasks with the same group share a color drawn from the category10 palette; per-task color overrides are supported. Builder API: `with_task`, `with_task_group`, `with_task_group_progress`, `with_task_progress`, `with_colored_task`, `with_milestone`, `with_milestone_group`, `with_now_line`, `with_group_order`, `with_bar_height`, `with_milestone_size`, `with_show_labels`, `with_group_bg`. `render_gantt` convenience function. CLI: `kuva gantt` with `--label-col`, `--start-col`, `--end-col`, `--group-col`, `--progress-col`, `--milestone-col`, `--now`, `--bar-height`, `--no-labels`. **V2 features (dependency arrows, lane stacking) deferred to next version.**
- **`NetworkPlot`** — node-edge network / graph diagram with force-directed (Fruchterman-Reingold) and circular layout algorithms. Supports edge-list and adjacency-matrix input, directed/undirected edges, self-loops, weighted edges (stroke width + opacity), per-node color/size/group, and group-based legends. CLI: `kuva network`.
- **`WafflePlot`** — waffle / unit chart displaying categorical proportions as a grid of colored cells. Supports square and circle cell shapes, configurable grid dimensions, fill order, empty-cell color, unit annotation, show-counts / show-percents labels, and legend. CLI: `kuva waffle`.
- **`HorizonPlot`** — compact multi-series time series visualization. Each series occupies a single row; the value range is divided into N equal-width bands folded onto that row with progressively darker shading. Positive and negative deviations use separate color families. Supports configurable band count, row height, baseline, value-max, and optional band-scale annotations. CLI: `kuva horizon`.
- **`PrPlot`** (Precision-Recall Curve) — precision-recall curve with AUC-PR computed via trapezoidal integration. Supports per-group curves from raw `(score, label)` predictions or pre-computed `(recall, precision)` points, optional optimal-F1 threshold marker, optional AUC label in legend, baseline (random classifier) line, and multi-group legend. CLI: `kuva pr`.
- **`PopulationPyramid`** — back-to-back horizontal bar chart for age/gender structure visualization. Supports single and multi-series (Grouped/Overlap modes), percentage normalization, value labels, per-series colors, and configurable bar width and gap. CLI: `kuva pyramid`.
- **Native Sankey/alluvial ordering** — `SankeyPlot` now supports ordered alluvium input via `with_alluvium()`, `with_alluvia()`, and `with_axis_names()`, plus optional weighted crossing reduction and neighbornet ordering through `with_crossing_reduction()`, `with_neighbornet()`, `with_node_order()`, and `with_node_order_seed()`. Node coloring can follow per-label or left-propagated alluvial coloring via `with_node_coloring()` / `with_left_coloring()`. CLI: `kuva sankey --axis-col ... --node-order crossings|neighbornet --coloring label|left`.
- **13 new CLI subcommands**: `slope`, `lollipop`, `raincloud`, `mosaic`, `waffle`, `pyramid`, `roc`, `pr`, `survival`, `horizon`, `parallel`, `venn`, `calendar` — covering all previously library-only plot types.
- **`kuva --version` / `-V`** — `kuva` CLI now reports its version string. Closes [#69](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/69).
- **`BrickPlot` bladerunner stitched STRIGAR format** — `with_strigars` now handles bladerunner's multi-candidate stitched format: `|` separates candidates; inter-candidate gaps render as `N@` (large gap) or `@:seq`/`1@` (small gap, light grey). Canonical-rotation normalisation operates across all candidates.
- **`BrickPlot::with_start_positions(iter)`** and **`BrickPlot::with_x_origin(f)`** — per-read genomic start coordinates for aligned repeat region display; `with_x_origin` sets the reference coordinate that maps to x = 0.
- **`StripPlot` per-point markers** — `with_group_markers(label, values, markers)` assigns a distinct marker shape per point within a strip group (triangle, square, diamond, cross, star, plus).
- **`Figure` legend position extensions** — `FigureLegendPosition` now includes `OutsideRightMiddle`, `OutsideRightBottom`, `OutsideTopLeft`, `OutsideTopCenter`, `OutsideTopRight`, `OutsideBottomLeft`, `OutsideBottomCenter`, `OutsideBottomRight`, `OutsideLeftTop`, `OutsideLeftMiddle`, `OutsideLeftBottom` in addition to the existing `Right`, `Bottom`, `Custom`.
- **Text wrapping** — long axis labels, titles, and legend items are now automatically wrapped at word boundaries when they exceed the available width.
- **`ColorMap` extended** — added `Cividis`, `Turbo`, `Cubehelix`, `RdYlGn`, `BrBG`, `PuOr`, and `Spectral` palettes.
- **`Layout::with_width_gap(px)`** and **`Layout::with_height_gap(px)`** — explicit per-axis gap overrides for fine-tuning panel spacing in `Figure` grids.
- **`BrickPlot` figure normalisation** — row heights are normalised to a consistent pixel height when `BrickPlot` is placed inside a `Figure` panel.
- **`JointPlot`** — scatter plot with marginal histograms or KDE density curves on the top and right axes; multi-group support via `JointGroup`; `MarginalType` enum (Histogram/Density); 9 tests.
- **`Clustermap`** — hierarchical clustermap: heatmap with UPGMA-computed row and column dendrograms rendered as `PhyloTree` panels; `ClustermapNorm` for row/column z-score normalisation; `AnnotationTrack` for categorical bar annotations on rows or columns; pre-supplied `PhyloTree` override; colorbar. Closes [#59](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/59).
- **Heatmap row/column reordering** — `Heatmap::with_y_categories(order)` permutes data rows so the first label renders at the top; `with_x_categories(order)` permutes columns. Order is expressed as label names. Closes [#59](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/59).
- **`Layout::with_equal_aspect()`** — expands the shorter axis so that 1 data unit spans the same number of pixels on both x and y; no-op on log axes and pixel-space plots (polar, ternary, pie, chord, etc.). Guards against degenerate zero-width ranges. 5 tests. Closes [#58](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/58).
- **CLI `--y` multi-column** — `kuva scatter` and `kuva line` now accept comma-separated column names or indices for `--y` (e.g. `--y A,B,C`); one auto-colored series is created per column; conflicts with `--color-by`. Legend labels use column header names when present, otherwise `col_N`. Partially closes [#57](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/57).
- **`RocPlot`** — ROC curve with trapezoidal AUC, DeLong 95% CI bands, partial AUC, Youden's J optimal-threshold marker, AUC label in legend, and diagonal chance-level reference line; 14 tests. CLI: `kuva roc`.
- **`LollipopPlot`** — lollipop / mutation landscape chart: vertical stems with dot markers, per-point labels and colors, and protein-domain annotation rectangles via `LollipopDomain`; 15 tests. CLI: `kuva lollipop`.
- **`SurvivalPlot`** (Kaplan–Meier) — right-continuous step-function survival curve with Greenwood 95% CI bands, censoring tick marks, multi-group legend, and optional log-rank p-value annotation; 12 tests. CLI: `kuva survival`.
- **`RaincloudPlot`** — half-violin KDE cloud + box-and-whisker + jittered rain in a single panel; per-group colors; `with_flip`, `with_bandwidth_scale`, and `with_cloud`/`with_box`/`with_rain` toggles; 11 tests. CLI: `kuva raincloud`.
- **`SlopePlot`** (dumbbell plot) — paired before/after values connected by a line; direction-based coloring (up/down/flat); outer-anchored, collision-safe labels; configurable dot size and group colors; 13 tests. CLI: `kuva slope`.
- **`VennPlot`** — Venn diagram for 2–4 sets; classic and proportional circle/ellipse layouts; raw element or pre-computed size input; region labels with per-set colored indicator dots; hybrid inline + leader-line labeling with march-outward anchor placement; `with_leader_lines`, `with_set_indicators`, `with_proportional`, `with_loss`; 21 tests. CLI: `kuva venn`.
- **`ParallelPlot`** — parallel coordinates chart; per-axis independent normalisation; optional shared scale; polyline + cubic-Bézier rendering; group colors + legend; optional mean overlay; axis inversion with orange indicator; adaptive h_inset / tick font scaling to prevent label collision on dense axes; 16 tests. CLI: `kuva parallel`.
- **`MosaicPlot`** — Marimekko / mosaic chart: variable-width columns proportional to column totals with stacked segments; custom y-axis (0–100%); cell percent and/or raw value labels; `with_normalize`, `with_gap`, `with_col_order`, `with_row_order`, `with_group_colors`; 12 tests. CLI: `kuva mosaic`.
- **`StreamgraphPlot`** — stream graph with Catmull-Rom smooth curves; `StreamBaseline` (Wiggle/Symmetric/Zero); `StreamOrder` (InsideOut/ByTotal/Original); inter-stream strokes; inline stream labels at the widest point; 100% normalisation mode; 20 tests.
- **`RadarPlot`** — radar / spider chart: N clockwise axes from the top; filled/stroked polygons; shared or per-axis normalisation; dashed grid rings; vertex dots; legend; 13 tests.
- **`TreemapPlot`** — treemap with squarified/slice-dice/binary layouts; depth-decreasing padding; ByParent/ByValue/Explicit color modes; `with_go_terms()` GO-enrichment convenience builder; SVG hover tooltips; colorbar; 23 tests. CLI: `kuva treemap`.
- **`SunburstPlot`** — sunburst / concentric ring hierarchy using the same `TreemapNode` data model as `TreemapPlot`; donut style via `with_inner_radius`; configurable start angle, ring gap, min label angle, and max depth; ByParent/ByValue/Explicit color modes; colorbar; SVG hover tooltips; 21 tests. CLI: `kuva sunburst`.
- **`BumpPlot`** — bump chart: rank-over-time visualization with sigmoid or straight curves; auto-ranking from raw values; `BumpTieBreak` modes (Average/Min/Max/Stable); highlight one series and mute others; collision-safe endpoint labels; rank labels inside dots; 23 tests. CLI: `kuva bump`.
- **`FunnelPlot`** — funnel chart with vertical/horizontal orientations; trapezoidal connectors; adaptive inside/outside value labels; step-to-step conversion rate annotations; Uniform/ByStage/Gradient color modes; diverging back-to-back mirror mode; 22 tests. CLI: `kuva funnel`.
- **`RosePlot`** — Nightingale rose / coxcomb chart: area-proportional encoding (r ∝ √value) for perceptually accurate wedge sizing; Stacked/Grouped multi-series modes; `with_bearing_data` auto-bins raw directional values into N equal sectors; compass labels; donut hole via `with_inner_radius`; 25 tests. CLI: `kuva rose`.
- **`CalendarPlot`** — calendar heatmap (GitHub-contribution style); full-year and arbitrary date-range periods via `CalendarPeriod`; Count/Sum/Mean/Max aggregation; GitHub-green sqrt-gamma default colormap; month separator L-step paths; colorbar. CLI: `kuva calendar`.
- **Stats box** — `Layout::with_stats_box()` / `with_stats_entry(label, value)` / `with_stats_box_at(position)` / `with_stats_title(s)`: a `LegendPosition`-positioned bordered text box for annotating plots with summary statistics; stacks vertically below the legend when placed at the same position; 7 tests.

### Fixed

- **CSV quoted fields** — commas inside double-quoted fields (RFC 4180 §2.6) are no longer misinterpreted as delimiters. The CLI CSV parser now uses the `csv` crate for fully spec-compliant parsing. Previously, a header like `"data,test"` would shift all subsequent column indices, causing the wrong column to be plotted silently. Closes [#74](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/74).
- **Line plot y-axis zero anchor** — `Layout::auto_from_plots` no longer anchors the y-axis at 0 for plot types where zero has no semantic meaning (line, scatter, series, band, box, violin, strip, raincloud, bump, candlestick, contour, hexbin, scatter3d, forest, parallel, slope, QQ). The axis now fits the data range with a small breathing margin. Plots where zero *is* meaningful (bar, histogram, stacked area, waterfall, lollipop, density, ridgeline, ECDF, survival, ROC, PR, funnel, streamgraph) are unaffected. When non-negative data genuinely starts at or near zero, the margin is clamped so the axis does not cross into negative territory. Closes [#75](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/75).
- **`Layout::anchor_y_zero`** — new `bool` field (default `true`) that controls whether `auto_from_plots` clamps the y-axis minimum to zero for non-negative data. Set automatically based on the plot types present; can also be overridden manually for custom layouts.
- **`Figure` column x-positions** — cell x-coordinates and multi-column span widths now use per-column prefix sums instead of uniform `cell_width × col`, so explicit `with_col_width` overrides are correctly reflected in cell placement.
- **Fonts in minimal environments** — DejaVu Sans is now bundled inside the crate and loaded into the font database before system fonts in the PNG and PDF backends. Plots rendered in containers or CI pipelines with no installed fonts (e.g. bioconda recipes) will now have correct text rendering instead of blank labels.
- **`SvgBackend::with_embedded_font(true)`** — new builder method that injects a base64-encoded `@font-face` block into the SVG `<style>` element, making the SVG self-contained for environments where system fonts are unavailable (headless servers, `rsvg-convert` in containers, etc.). Off by default to keep SVG file sizes small. CLI: `--embed-font`. Closes [#71](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/71).
- **`BumpPlot` endpoint label clipping** — endpoint labels on bump charts are now drawn after `ClipEnd` so they are no longer clipped at the plot edge when the final rank is 1 or the series extends to the rightmost column.
- **`StripPlot` legend overflow** — legend box width is now correctly sized from the longest group label when `with_group_colors` is used; previously the box was too narrow and clipped text.
- **`JointPlot` in figure context** — scatter panel, right-marginal histogram, and legend now fit cleanly within the allocated cell. Legend space is carved from `scatter_canvas_w` upfront rather than overflowing into adjacent cells.
- **`JointPlot` axis label centering** — x-label is now centred on the scatter axis (not the full canvas); y-label is centred on the scatter panel height.
- **`JointPlot` label duplication in figure** — x/y labels are suppressed from `add_labels_and_title` when a `JointPlot` is detected in the panel; the custom-positioned labels are the only ones drawn.
- **Clippy warnings (Rust 1.85)** — resolved `collapsible_match`, `useless_conversion` (`into_iter`), `unnecessary_sort_by`, and `clone_on_copy` lints across `dotplot.rs`, `upset.rs`, `candlestick.rs`, `network.rs`, `layout.rs`, `render.rs`, and `src/bin/kuva/rose.rs`.
- **Legend height overflow** — legends with more entries than fit in the canvas height are now capped: visible entries fill the available space (minimum 10 always shown) and a `… (+N more)` line is appended. The canvas right margin is automatically widened to fit the overflow label so it is not clipped by the canvas edge. Affects `BrickPlot` loci with large numbers of distinct repeat motifs (e.g. CANVAS, NIID) as well as any plot using `with_legend_entries` with many entries.
- **Legend bounding box height after entry capping** — when entries were truncated to fit the canvas height, the background and border rectangles were still drawn at the full (pre-cap) height, causing the box to extend below the canvas. The box is now resized to match the number of entries actually rendered.
- **`OutsideBottomColumns` legend Y position** — the legend was anchored relative to the bottom of the plot axes area rather than the bottom of the x-axis content, causing it to overlap tick labels and the axis label. The anchor is now `height − legend_bottom_extra`, i.e. the first pixel below the x-axis content.

### Changed

- **Bundled font compressed** — DejaVu Sans TTF is now stored as a gzip stream (~358 KB, down from ~757 KB raw) and inflated on first use via `OnceLock`. Saves ~400 KB from the published crate at the cost of a one-time ~5–10 ms inflate on first font access. The raw `.ttf` is retained in the repo for regeneration but excluded from the published crate.
- **`Heatmap::with_x_range(lo, hi)` / `with_y_range(lo, hi)`** — set custom axis extents for the heatmap so it can represent a scalar field over a physical domain (e.g. `with_x_range(-10.0, 10.0)`, `with_y_range(-4.0, 4.0)`). Cell positions are mapped linearly across the specified range; default behaviour (`[0.5, cols+0.5]` / `[0.5, rows+0.5]`) is unchanged when neither method is called. 5 tests. Closes [#64](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/64).
- **`Heatmap::with_cell_size(factor)`** — controls the fraction of each cell's natural size used when drawing the cell rectangle. Default `0.99` preserves the existing thin gap between cells; `1.0` draws cells flush with no visible boundary, which is recommended for large grids where the gap becomes a distracting pattern. Values are clamped to `[0.5, 1.0]`. 3 tests.

- **Unified numerical input types** — all data-entry builder methods now accept `impl Into<f64>` instead of bare `f64`, so `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, and `f32` values can be passed directly without `.into()` or `as f64`. Affects `BarPlot` (`with_bar`, `with_colored_bar`, `with_colored_bars`, `with_bars`, `with_group`), `WaterfallPlot` (`with_delta`, `with_difference`), `ForestPlot` (`with_row`, `with_weighted_row`, `with_colored_row`, `with_weighted_colored_row`, `ForestRow::new`), `MosaicPlot` (`with_cell`, `with_cells`), `RosePlot` (`with_slice`, `with_slices`), `SankeyPlot` (`with_link`, `with_link_colored`, `with_links`, `with_alluvium`), `TernaryPlot` (`with_point`, `with_point_group`, `with_points`), `ParallelPlot` (`with_row`, `with_row_group`), `NetworkPlot` (`with_edge`, `with_edge_color`, `with_edge_label`, `with_edge_styled`, `with_edges`), `LollipopPlot` (`with_points`). Closes [#68](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/68).

## [0.1.6] — 2026-04-01

- **`DicePlot`** — new plot type: a grid of cells where each cell shows up to 6 dots in a canonical die-face layout. Ports rendering logic from the [ggdiceplot](https://github.com/maflot/ggdiceplot) R package (v1.2.0). Three input modes: categorical (`with_records`), continuous tile (`with_points`), and per-dot continuous (`with_dot_data`) for ZEBRA-style domino plots. Pip sizing uses the ggdiceplot 1.2.0 tight-packing algorithm with `pip_scale = 0.75` and offset shrinkage. Legend support: spatial-position legend (mini die faces), categorical colour legend, and size legend sections. Column-major grid positions match `make_offsets()`.
- **Custom X/Theta-Tick-Labels for `PolarPlot`** — Re-uses `with_x_tick_format()` for theta axis on `PolarPlot`. Introduces new default `TickFormat::Degree` for `PolarPlot`, so default behavior is unchanged. 
### Fixed

- **docs.rs build** — `doom` feature build script no longer attempts to write to the source directory or access the network when building on docs.rs. Empty placeholder files are written to `OUT_DIR` instead so `include_bytes!` compiles cleanly.

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- **SVG interactivity v1** (`--interactive` / `Layout::with_interactive()`) — opt-in, self-contained browser interactivity embedded directly in the SVG output with no external dependencies. Degrades silently to a static SVG in PNG/PDF/terminal/Inkscape contexts. Features: hover tooltips, click-to-pin (sticky highlight; Escape to clear), search + dim (text input dims non-matching elements), coordinate readout (cursor x/y in data space shown on hover), and legend toggle (click a legend entry to show/hide the corresponding series). Wired for scatter, line, bar, strip, and volcano plots in this release; remaining renderers deferred to v0.2.
- **`kuva doom`** (`--features cli,doom`) — generates a fully self-contained, offline-playable DOOM SVG (~15 MB). Open in any browser and play with keyboard controls. The Chocolate Doom engine (GPL v2) and shareware WAD are base64-encoded directly into the SVG at build time; no server, no network requests, no external files needed. Easter egg feature, separate from the plotting library.
- **`kuva bar --color-by <COL>`** — grouped bar chart mode. Groups rows by the specified column and creates one colored series per unique value using the active palette, with an automatic legend. When each x-label maps to exactly one series (e.g. `--color-by` equals `--label-col`), falls back to simple per-bar coloring instead of a grouped layout.
- **`kuva strip --legend`** — assigns palette colors per group and shows a legend. Combines with `--interactive` for legend toggle.
- **`PolarPlot` negative radius / `r_min` support** (`--r-min`) — `PolarPlot::with_r_min(f64)` sets the value mapped to the plot centre (default: 0). Points below `r_min` clamp to centre; ring labels show actual r values. CLI: `kuva polar --r-min <F>`. Closes #54.
- **Custom X/Theta-Tick-Labels for `PolarPlot`** — `with_x_tick_format()` now applies to the theta axis on polar plots. New `TickFormat::Degree` default keeps existing behaviour unchanged.
- **`Layout::with_polar_r_label_angle(deg)`** — override the angle at which r-axis ring labels are drawn (default: midpoint between spokes).
- **`ForestPlot`** — forest plot for meta-analysis: point estimates with confidence intervals on a categorical Y-axis, vertical dashed null-effect reference line, optional weight-scaled markers. CLI: `kuva forest data.tsv --label-col study --estimate-col estimate --ci-lower-col lower --ci-upper-col upper`.
- **`Scatter3DPlot`** — 3D scatter plot with orthographic projection, depth-sorted painter's algorithm, z-colormap, depth shading, per-point colors/sizes, configurable markers, and matplotlib-style open-box wireframe with grid on all three back walls. CLI: `kuva scatter3d data.tsv --x x --y y --z z`.
- **`Surface3DPlot`** — 3D surface mesh rendered as depth-sorted filled quadrilaterals with z-colormap, wireframe edges, alpha transparency, `with_data_fn()` for function sampling, and `--resolution N` bilinear interpolation upsampling. CLI: `kuva surface3d data.tsv --x x --y y --z z --z-color viridis`.
- **Shared 3D infrastructure** — `Projection3D` orthographic projection module, `View3D` view angles, `Box3DConfig` shared configuration, `draw_3d_box()` reusable box/grid/axes renderer, `DataRanges3D` bounding box, `ColorMap::map_rgb()` zero-allocation colormap path.
- **`parse_colormap`** consolidated into shared `data.rs` helper (was duplicated 6x across CLI modules).
- **`Figure::with_twin_y_plots(cell, primary, secondary)`** — twin-Y panels now work inside multi-panel `Figure` grid layouts. Auto-layout via `Layout::auto_from_twin_y_plots`; shared legend collection includes both primary and secondary plots.
- **Fine-grained axis and grid line controls** — new `Layout` builder methods: `with_axis_line_width(f)`, `with_tick_width(f)`, `with_tick_length(f)`, `with_grid_line_width(f)`. All propagate through `ComputedLayout`; grid lines now drawn before axis borders (z-order fix). CLI: `--tick-length`, `--tick-width`, `--grid-stroke`.
- **SVG clip-path support** — data elements are now clipped to the plot area, preventing points and lines from rendering outside the axis borders. Implemented via `Primitive::ClipStart`/`ClipEnd`; ignored by terminal and raster backends. Closes #53.
- **`Histogram2D::with_log_count()`** — log₁₀-scaled colour axis for 2D histograms. Colorbar tick marks are placed at actual count values (0, 1, 10, 100 …) and labelled accordingly. CLI: `kuva hist2d --log-count`. Also adds `Layout::with_colorbar_tick_format(TickFormat)` / CLI `--colorbar-tick-format`.
- **`SankeyPlot` flow labels** — `with_flow_labels()` annotates each ribbon with its flow value; `with_flow_label_units(s)` adds a unit string; `with_flow_label_decimals(n)` controls precision; `with_flow_label_percents()` shows percentages of total flow. CLI: `kuva sankey --flow-labels [--flow-label-percents]`.
- **`kuva heatmap` long-format input** — accepts a value column (`--value-col`) from long-format data (row, column, value triples) with optional per-cell aggregation (`--agg-fn mean|sum|min|max|count`). Wide-format matrix input unchanged.
- **`kuva bar --agg <FUNC>`** — aggregate a numeric value column by a label column using `mean`, `median`, `sum`, `min`, or `max` before plotting. Complements `--count-by` for summarising long-format data.
- **`kuva volcano` and `kuva manhattan` — `--pvalue-col-is-log`** — accept a pre-computed −log₁₀(p) column directly; internally un-transforms via 10^(−v) before passing raw p-values to the plot struct.
- **Colorbar title moved to side** — colorbar titles now render rotated on the left side of the colorbar rather than above it, matching common convention and preventing overlap with axis labels.
- **Per-subcommand CLI documentation** — all CLI subcommands now have dedicated documentation pages at `docs/src/cli/<subcommand>.md`. Closes #36.
- **`BrickPlot` bladerunner stitched STRIGAR format** — `with_strigars` now handles bladerunner's multi-candidate stitched format: `|` separates candidates, each with its own local letter namespace. Inter-candidate gaps appear as `N@` (large gap, N nucleotides wide, no motif entry) or `@:seq` / `1@` (small gap, rendered at `len(seq)` nt). Gap bricks render as light grey. Canonical-rotation normalisation operates across all candidates, so ACCCTA / TAACCC / CCCTAA in different candidates are automatically assigned the same global letter and colour.
- **`BrickPlot::with_start_positions(iter)`** — per-read genomic start coordinates. Pass the reference position where each read begins; kuva shifts rows on the shared x-axis so repeat regions align visually. Equivalent to `with_x_offsets` with negated values but expresses intent clearly.
- **`BrickPlot::with_x_origin(f)`** — sets the reference coordinate that maps to x = 0 on the axis. Applied on top of (and independently from) any per-row offsets; use alongside `with_start_positions` to anchor a biologically meaningful position such as a repeat start to the axis origin.
- **`BrickPlot` per-read offsets in strigar mode** — `with_x_offsets` and `with_start_positions` now apply in strigar mode (previously forced to zero).
- **`BrickPlot` bounds fix with offsets** — x-axis range is now computed per-row using actual row widths and offsets in both DNA and strigar modes, preventing reads from being clipped at the right edge when start positions push them beyond the widest unshifted row.

### Fixed
- **Manhattan chromosome labels not visible** — labels were previously emitted inside the SVG clip-path group, placing them below the clip boundary (the data area) and making them invisible. Labels are now drawn after `ClipEnd` so they render outside the clip region.
- **Multi-panel figure axis ranges** — manually set `with_x_axis_min/max` / `with_y_axis_min/max` values were silently dropped when used inside `Figure` panels. Now correctly forwarded through `clone_layout`. Closes #43.
- **Terminal y-axis label** — `--y-label` text is now rendered vertically (one character per row) in `--terminal` mode instead of horizontally, preventing overlap with the plot area.
- **Terminal legend swatches** — circle-based legend swatches (scatter, density, volcano, manhattan, etc.) now show their actual series color instead of being masked by the legend background in `--terminal` mode.
- **Polar r-label / theta-label overlap** — r-axis ring labels are now positioned at the midpoint angle between spokes instead of directly on the 0° spoke.
- **Histogram zero-height bins** — zero-count bins are now skipped before emitting a `Rect` primitive, eliminating SVG zero-height rect warnings. Closes #51.
- **Density plot boundary leakage** — replaced post-hoc KDE clipping with boundary reflection (ggplot2-style): ghost points mirrored at user-specified bounds restore lost kernel mass so the curve terminates smoothly. `with_x_lo(f)` / `with_x_hi(f)` allow one-sided bounds; `with_x_range(lo, hi)` is kept as a shorthand. Closes #47.
- **Density plot normalization** — `bounds()` sample count now matches the renderer; `--x-min` / `--x-max` CLI flags correctly restrict the KDE evaluation range. Closes #37.
- **Histogram2D with real data** — CLI now accepts `--x-min`/`--x-max`/`--y-min`/`--y-max` to control the binning range; off-by-one at the upper edge clamped to the last bin. Closes #39.
- **Histogram x-axis label truncation** — right margin now accounts for the last tick label's half-width so labels are never clipped. Closes #46.
- **Heatmap / PDF cell limit** — a hard 1 M cell limit in `kuva heatmap` now emits a clear error with the cell count and concrete aggregation suggestions instead of silently producing a broken PDF. Closes #38.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Twin-Y documentation** — new `docs/src/plots/twin_y.md` covering `render_twin_y`, `auto_from_twin_y_plots`, axis labels, log y2 scale, mixed plot types, palette auto-assignment, and manual range overrides; four SVG examples including a GC bias QC chart.
- **Per-point colors on `StripPlot`** — `with_colored_group(label, iter_of_(value, color)_pairs)` adds a group where each point carries its own color. Colors are matched by position; points beyond the color list fall back to the group/uniform color. Useful when each observation belongs to a distinct category (e.g. motif type) and needs to be visually distinguished within a single column.
- **`PolarPlot`** — polar coordinate scatter/line plot with configurable radial/angular grid, compass (θ=0 north, CW) or math (θ=0 east, CCW) conventions. Supports multiple labeled series, r-max override, r-value labels, spoke angle labels. CLI: `kuva polar --r <COL> --theta <COL> [--color-by <COL>] [--mode scatter|line] [--r-max <F>] [--theta-divisions <N>] [--theta-start <DEG>]`. Closes #25.
- **`TernaryPlot`** — ternary/simplex scatter plot with barycentric coordinate system and equilateral triangle geometry. Auto-normalize with `with_normalize(true)`, configurable grid lines (dashed), percentage tick labels on each edge, bold corner labels, and multi-group coloring. CLI: `kuva ternary --a <COL> --b <COL> --c <COL> [--color-by <COL>] [--a-label <S>] [--b-label <S>] [--c-label <S>] [--normalize] [--grid-lines <N>]`. Closes #8.
- **`RidgelinePlot`** — ridgeline (joyplot) plot with stacked KDE density curves, one per group. Groups are labelled on the y-axis; the x-axis is the continuous data range. Supports `.with_group(label, data)`, `.with_group_color(label, data, color)`, `.with_groups(iter)`, `.with_filled(bool)`, `.with_opacity(f64)`, `.with_overlap(f64)`, `.with_bandwidth(f64)`, `.with_kde_samples(usize)`, `.with_stroke_width(f64)`, `.with_normalize(bool)`, `.with_legend(bool)`, and `.with_line_dash(s)`. CLI: `kuva ridgeline --value <COL> [--group-by <COL>] [--overlap <F>] [--filled] [--bandwidth <F>]`.
- **`DensityPlot`** — kernel density estimate curve over a single numeric column. Gaussian KDE via Silverman's rule (or manual bandwidth), normalised to a proper probability density function (integral ≈ 1). Supports `.with_filled(bool)`, `.with_opacity(f64)`, `.with_bandwidth(f64)`, `.with_kde_samples(usize)`, `.with_stroke_width(f64)`, `.with_line_dash(s)`, `.with_legend(s)`, and `from_curve(x, y)` for pre-computed curves. Multi-group plots use one `DensityPlot` per group with `render_multiple` + palette. CLI: `kuva density --value <COL> [--color-by <COL>] [--filled] [--bandwidth <F>]`. Closes #15.
- **`Histogram::from_bins(edges, counts)`** — create a histogram from precomputed bin edges and counts rather than raw values. `edges` must have length `counts.len() + 1`; counts are `f64` to support fractional values (density estimates, normalised outputs from R/numpy). Closes #24.
- **`LegendPosition` expanded** — the 7 old variants are replaced by 20 new ones grouped by placement zone. All names are now prefixed with `Inside` or `Outside`:
  - *Inside* (overlaid on the data area, 8 px inset): `InsideTopRight`, `InsideTopLeft`, `InsideBottomRight`, `InsideBottomLeft`, `InsideTopCenter`, `InsideBottomCenter`
  - *Outside right margin*: `OutsideRightTop` *(new default)*, `OutsideRightMiddle`, `OutsideRightBottom`
  - *Outside left margin*: `OutsideLeftTop`, `OutsideLeftMiddle`, `OutsideLeftBottom`
  - *Outside top margin*: `OutsideTopLeft`, `OutsideTopCenter`, `OutsideTopRight`
  - *Outside bottom margin*: `OutsideBottomLeft`, `OutsideBottomCenter`, `OutsideBottomRight`
  - `Custom(f64, f64)` — absolute SVG canvas pixel coordinates (what `with_legend_at` now sets internally)
  - `DataCoords(f64, f64)` — data-space coordinates mapped through `map_x`/`map_y` at render time
- **`Layout::with_legend_box(bool)`** — suppress the legend background and border rects; entries and swatches still render
- **`Layout::with_legend_title(s)`** — renders a bold title row above all legend entries
- **`Layout::with_legend_group(title, entries)`** — adds a labelled group of entries; multiple calls stack and take priority over `with_legend_entries`
- **`Layout::with_legend_at_data(x, y)`** — places the legend at data-space coordinates (`DataCoords` variant); no right-margin reserved
- **`LegendGroup` struct** — `{ title: String, entries: Vec<LegendEntry> }`; exported from `kuva::plot`
- **`Layout::with_legend_width(px)`** / **`with_legend_height(px)`** — override auto-computed legend box dimensions
- **`Layout::with_scale(f)`** — uniform scale factor for all plot chrome: font sizes, margins, tick mark lengths, stroke widths, legend padding/swatch geometry, and annotation arrow sizes. Canvas `width`/`height` are unaffected. CLI: `--scale` on all subcommands.
- **Fine-grained tick and gridline control** ([#13](https://github.com/Psy-Fer/kuva/issues/13)) — `Layout::with_x_axis_min/max`, `with_y_axis_min/max`, `with_x_tick_step`, `with_y_tick_step`, `with_minor_ticks(n)`, `with_show_minor_grid(bool)`; minor ticks are 3 px marks; minor gridlines use 0.5 stroke-width. CLI: `--x-min`, `--x-max`, `--y-min`, `--y-max`, `--x-tick-step`, `--y-tick-step`, `--minor-ticks`, `--minor-grid`.
- **Per-point colors on `ScatterPlot` and per-group colors on `StripPlot`** — `ScatterPlot::with_colors(iter)` indexed per point; `StripPlot::with_group_colors(iter)` indexed per group. Both fall back to the uniform `color` field for out-of-range indices. `ScatterPlot::bounds()` now returns `None` on empty data rather than panicking.
- **Per-group colors on `ViolinPlot` and `BoxPlot`** — `with_group_colors(iter)` added to both, mirroring `StripPlot`. All elements of a box group (box, whiskers, caps) share the group color. CLI: `--group-colors` (comma-separated) on `kuva violin` and `kuva box`.
- **Circle marker opacity + stroke** — `Primitive::Circle` and `Primitive::CircleBatch` now carry `fill_opacity: Option<f64>`, `stroke: Option<Color>`, and `stroke_width: Option<f64>`. Builder methods `with_marker_opacity(f64)` and `with_marker_stroke_width(f64)` added to `ScatterPlot`, `StripPlot`, `PolarPlot` (per-series), and `TernaryPlot`.
- **`Color` type** (`render::color`) — 3-variant enum (`Rgb/None/Css`) replacing `String` for fill/stroke in the render pipeline; `Color::Rgb(u8,u8,u8)` is 4 bytes inline with zero heap allocation; `From<&str>` parses hex, `rgb()`, `"none"`, and 50+ named CSS colors.
- **`CircleBatch` and `RectBatch`** — SoA (struct-of-arrays) `Primitive` variants with contiguous coordinate arrays for scatter and heatmap; all backends support them.
- **Benchmark suite** — `benches/render.rs`, `benches/svg.rs`, `benches/kde.rs` with Criterion; `docs/src/benchmarks.md` with tables and run instructions.

### Changed

- `Layout::with_legend_at(x, y)` now sets `legend_position = Custom(x, y)`; `legend_xy` field removed
- Margin calculation in `ComputedLayout::from_layout` is position-aware: `Inside*`, `Custom`, and `DataCoords` add no margin; `Outside*` variants expand the appropriate edge
- `render_legend_at` signature extended with `groups`, `title`, and `show_box` parameters
- Legend width auto-sizing character multiplier increased from 7.0 → 8.5 px/char
- `Primitive::Path` now uses `Box<PathData>` — shrinks enum from ~128 to ~88 bytes per element
- SVG output uses hex colors for named CSS colors (e.g. `fill="red"` → `fill="#ff0000"`)
- **SVG serialization 50–70% faster** — replaced all `format!()` calls in `SvgBackend` with direct `push_str()`/`write!()`; eliminates per-primitive heap allocations in hot loops
- **Float formatting via `ryu`** — 2–5× faster float→string conversion; coordinates rounded to 2 decimal places; whole numbers omit the decimal point
- **Single-pass XML escaping** — `write_escaped()` scans text content once; no allocation when input has no special characters
- **`PngBackend` font database cached** — system fonts loaded once via `OnceLock`; eliminates 100ms+ overhead on repeated PNG renders
- **`Scene` pre-allocated** — `Scene::new()` accepts an estimated primitive count and calls `Vec::with_capacity()`
- **KDE truncated kernel** — `simple_kde` windows evaluations to `[x ± 4bw]` via binary search; ~8× faster at 100k samples
- **Manhattan pre-bucketing** — SNPs bucketed into `HashMap<&str, Vec<usize>>` before span loop; ~22× faster at 1M SNPs
- **Heatmap single-pass** — two nested loops merged into one; intermediate `flat: Vec<f64>` allocation eliminated

### Fixed

- **`render_twin_y` now supports `Plot::Density`** — `DensityPlot` was silently dropped in both the primary and secondary match arms; it is now routed to `add_density` with the correct computed layout for each axis.
- **Legend overhaul** — background/border rects can now be suppressed via `with_legend_box(false)`; y-axis label x-position computed dynamically from actual tick label widths rather than a fixed offset; `margin_left` now uses actual tick string generation instead of a 6-char heuristic
- **`BrickPlot` strigar color/legend ordering** — deterministic sort replaces `HashMap` iteration order; output is now byte-identical across runs
- **Rotated x-axis tick labels** — `margin_left`/`margin_right` now account for horizontal projection of rotated labels; `TextAnchor::Start` used for positive rotation angles. Affects bar, waterfall, candlestick, and dot plots.
- **Terminal legend swatch alignment** — `LegendShape::Line` swatches now write to `char_grid` so they take priority over legend background; `LegendShape::Rect` snaps to `height × 0.75` so swatches land in the same row as their label at all terminal sizes
- **Terminal legend entry spacing** — legend entries step by exact whole-cell multiples (`round(18 / cell_h).max(1) * cell_h`); eliminates fractional-row misalignment across all terminal sizes and subcommands
- **Terminal phylo leaf label row** — removed `+ 4.0` SVG baseline offset on leaf labels for Left/Right orientations
- **`ridgeline` example** — output now written to `docs/src/assets/ridgeline/` instead of the repo root

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- `SvgBackend` is now a proper struct with `with_pretty(bool)` — `SvgBackend::new().with_pretty(true)` emits one element per line with 2-space indentation and group-depth tracking; compact output is unchanged and remains the default; a backward-compat `const SvgBackend` shim keeps all existing call sites compiling without modification
- `impl Default for SvgBackend` added (fixes `new_without_default` Clippy lint)

### Changed

- Default font family is now `"DejaVu Sans, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans-serif"` (previously fell back to the browser/renderer default); propagated through `ComputedLayout` and `Figure::render` via a shared `DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY` constant
- `title_size` default increased from 16 → 18 px
- `tick_size` default increased from 10 → 12 px; margins auto-expand from `tick_size` so no text is clipped
- CLI `--width` / `--height` flags are now optional with no default; canvas size is auto-computed from plot content when omitted, allowing pie outside-label widening and other layout-sensitive plots to size themselves correctly; explicit `--width`/`--height` still takes precedence

### Fixed

- **Brick plot legend order** — strigar motif legend entries are now sorted by global letter (A → Z) so the most-frequent motif always appears first
- **Sankey z-order** — node labels are now emitted after ribbons rather than before them; labels are no longer painted over by coloured ribbon bands
- **UpSet count labels** — intersection size labels above bars are suppressed when the column is too narrow to fit the number without overlapping an adjacent label
- **Pie outside label / legend overlap** — canvas widening for outside labels was blocked when the CLI forced `layout.width = Some(800)`; fixed by making `BaseArgs.width`/`height` `Option<f64>` so the widening condition fires correctly when the user has not explicitly set a size
- **Manhattan `--top-n`** — top-N point labels were filtered by the genome-wide significance threshold before selection, producing no labels when no points exceeded it; labels now pick the top-N most significant points unconditionally
- **Phylo circular whitespace** — replaced the conservative `hpad = edge_pad + label_pad` padding with a direct minimum-clearance formula (`max_r = min(pw/2 − edge_pad − label_gap − chars×7, ph/2 − edge_pad − 7)`); on an 800×800 canvas with 23-character leaf labels the tree radius increases from 94 px to 194 px

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-02

### Added

- `Figure::with_figure_size(w, h)` — specify total figure dimensions and have cell sizes auto-computed to fit, accounting for padding, spacing, title height, and shared legend area

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings resolved: `type_complexity` in `TerminalBackend` (extracted `type Rgb = (u8, u8, u8)`), `manual_is_multiple_of` in `render_utils`, and `needless_range_loop` suppressed on intentional triangular matrix loops in chord rendering
- `test_missing_feature_error` / `test_missing_feature_pdf` marked `#[ignore]` — these tests check a compile-time feature gate and were producing false-positive failures when a stale binary built with `--features full` was present on disk
- CI Clippy step now runs with `-D warnings` — all warnings are errors

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- `kuva::prelude::*` — single-import module re-exporting all plot structs, `Plot`, `Layout`, `Figure`, `Theme`, `Palette`, render helpers, backends, annotations, and datetime utilities
- `Into<Plot>` for all 25 plot structs — write `plot.into()` instead of `Plot::Scatter(plot)`
- `render_to_svg(plots, layout) -> String` — full pipeline in one call
- `render_to_png(plots, layout, scale) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>` — one-call PNG output (feature `png`)
- `render_to_pdf(plots, layout) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>` — one-call PDF output (feature `pdf`)
- GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the mdBook documentation to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`

### Fixed

- Unresolved intra-doc links (`Rect`, `Text`, `Line`) in `backend::terminal` module doc

---
